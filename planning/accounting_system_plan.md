## Recommended Timeline and Resources

### Timeline Overview
- **Phase 1**: Months 1-3 (Foundation and Core Architecture)
- **Phase 2**: Months 3-6 (Core Accounting Modules)
- **Phase 3**: Months 6-9 (Advanced Features and ML/AI)
- **Phase 4**: Months 9-11 (Integration and Deployment)
- **Phase 5**: Month 12+ (Ongoing Enhancements)

### Resource Requirements

**Development Team:**
- 1 Tech Lead/Architect
- 2-3 Elixir developers
- 1 QA/Test Engineer
- 1 DevOps Engineer (part-time)

**Infrastructure:**
- Development environment (local or cloud)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.)
- Staging and production environments
- Database servers (PostgreSQL)
- Message broker (if using distributed deployment)

**Key Technologies:**
- Elixir
- Ash Framework
- AshCommanded
- PostgreSQL
- ETS
- Axon/BumbleBee (for ML/AI)
- LangChain/AshAi (for AI integration)

By following this phased approach, you'll be able to incrementally build a robust, modular accounting system that leverages Elixir's concurrency model, the Ash Framework's declarative resources, and modern AI/ML capabilities while maintaining the flexibility to customize business logic without modifying core code.
